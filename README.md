**How to Run the Code**

There are two methods to run the code, the first is a bit easier since you don't have to worry about project dependencies. The second, you need to manually add the file dependencies into the IDE.

Disclaimer: The codes are to be run on Jetbrains InteliJ. The steps shown are only applicable for the mention IDE only.

**METHOD 1**

1. Open InteliJ and create new JavaFX code.
2. You may name the java file however you like, just keep in mind that the default java class name is "_Hotel\_Management"_and the package name is "_com.example.javaguiproject_". If you to rename the file, remember to change the path name in the java code too.
3. Make sure these two options is tick. Finish creating javaFx project.

**METHOD 2**

1. Instead of letting the IDE to add dependencies, you need to add it yourself. Just create new project and remember to add the necessary directory to run the code.
2. Download javaFx libraries and it into project dependencies. The libraries are available in the GitHub.
3. Just move all the code into the project. Make sure all the path is correct to run the code.
